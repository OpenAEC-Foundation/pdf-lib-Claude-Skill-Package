## Session Start Protocol (P-001)
EVERY session begins with this sequence:

1. **Read ROADMAP.md** → Determine current phase, progress percentage, and "Next Steps" section
2. **Read LESSONS.md** → Check recent lessons that may affect your work
3. **Read DECISIONS.md** → Know all architectural decisions (D-001+) and their constraints
4. **Read REQUIREMENTS.md** → Understand quality guarantees and per-area requirements
5. **Read docs/masterplan/pdflib-masterplan.md** → Know the execution plan and current phase details
6. **If researching**: Read **SOURCES.md** → Know approved sources, verification rules
7. **If creating skills**: Read **WAY_OF_WORK.md** → Know skill structure, content standards, naming
8. Identify next action from ROADMAP.md "Next Steps"
9. Confirm with user before proceeding

---

## Meta-Orchestrator Protocol (P-002)

### Identity
This Claude Code session + the human user together ARE the **meta-orchestrator**.
We are NOT a relay/passthrough. We are the strategic brain.

**What we do HERE (the brain):**
- THINK: Analyze problems, design solutions, make architectural decisions
- STRATEGIZE: Plan agent batches, define task decomposition, choose approaches
- DECIDE: Accept/reject agent output, resolve conflicts, set direction
- COMPOSE: Craft precise agent prompts with full context from core files

**What agents do THERE (the hands):**
- EXECUTE: Research, write, code, validate — the actual work
- CROSS-VALIDATE: Agents check each other's output before it comes back to us
- REPORT: Deliver refined, verified output to the meta-orchestrator

### Rules:
- Delegate EXECUTION via Claude Code Agent tool — thinking stays here
- Validate before accepting (validator-before-apply)
- Strategic reasoning, planning, and decision-making happen in THIS session
- Agents receive complete context (core file references) so they can work autonomously

### What to include in EVERY agent prompt:
- Quality criteria from **REQUIREMENTS.md** (relevant to their task)
- Approved source URLs from **SOURCES.md** (what docs to consult)
- Current status from **ROADMAP.md** (what's done, what's needed)
- Relevant constraints from **DECISIONS.md** (D-003: English-only, D-009: 500 line limit, etc.)
- Skill structure from **WAY_OF_WORK.md** (if writing skills)

### Delegation Flow:
1. **Think** — Define task scope, expected output, success criteria
2. **Compose** — Write task prompt with core file references (see above)
3. **Spawn Agent** — Use Claude Code Agent tool with complete prompt
4. **Collect** — Receive agent output automatically
5. **Judge** — VALIDATE output against **REQUIREMENTS.md** quality criteria
6. **Iterate** — Accept, or respawn with corrections

### Batch Strategy:
- 3 agents per batch (optimal for Claude Code Agent tool)
- Separated file scopes (NEVER two agents on same file)
- Quality gate after every batch
- Cross-validation: review agent output before final acceptance

---

## Quality Control Protocol (P-003)
### Validation criteria sourced from core files:

**From REQUIREMENTS.md:**
- Skill format requirements (YAML frontmatter, structure)
- pdf-lib 1.x version coverage
- TypeScript code examples with proper types

**From DECISIONS.md:**
- D-003: English-only content
- D-005: MIT License
- D-009: SKILL.md < 500 lines

**From SOURCES.md:**
- All code verified against listed official sources only
- No unverified blog posts or outdated content

### Validator-Before-Apply checklist:
1. File exists and is complete
2. YAML frontmatter valid (name, description with trigger words)
3. Line count < 500 (SKILL.md)
4. English-only (no Dutch or other languages)
5. Deterministic language (ALWAYS/NEVER, not "you might consider")
6. TypeScript code examples with proper type annotations
7. All references/ files exist and are linked from SKILL.md
8. Sources traceable to **SOURCES.md** approved URLs

### Correction Flow:
If validation fails:
1. Document what failed in agent feedback
2. Spawn fix-agent with specific correction instructions
3. Re-validate after fix
4. NEVER accept below quality bar defined in **REQUIREMENTS.md**

---

## Research Protocol (P-004)
### Before ANY research:
1. Read **SOURCES.md** → Know approved sources for pdf-lib
2. Read **REQUIREMENTS.md** → Know what the research must cover
3. Read **DECISIONS.md** → Know constraints (D-003 English-only, D-007 pdf-lib 1.x only, D-012 WebFetch, etc.)

### During research:
- Use ONLY sources listed in **SOURCES.md** (or add new ones there)
- Verify code examples against official documentation
- Identify anti-patterns from real GitHub issues
- Use WebFetch to ensure latest documentation is consulted (D-012)

### After research:
1. Update **SOURCES.md** "Last Verified" table with verification date
2. Log new discoveries in **LESSONS.md** (numbered L-XXX)
3. If new architectural decisions emerge, record in **DECISIONS.md** (numbered D-XXX)

### Research output location:
- Vooronderzoek: `docs/research/vooronderzoek-pdflib.md`
- Topic research: `docs/research/topic-research/{skill-name}-research.md`
- Research fragments: `docs/research/fragments/`

---

## Skill Standards (P-005)
Defined in detail in **WAY_OF_WORK.md** and **REQUIREMENTS.md**. Quick reference:

- English-only (per **DECISIONS.md** D-003)
- Deterministic: "ALWAYS use X when Y" / "NEVER do X because Y"
- SKILL.md < 500 lines (per **DECISIONS.md** D-009), heavy content in references/
- YAML frontmatter: name + description with trigger words
- Structure: Quick Reference > Decision Trees > Patterns > Reference Links
- Naming: `pdflib-{category}-{topic}`
- TypeScript examples with proper type annotations
- Verify against **SOURCES.md** approved URLs only

---

## Document Sync Protocol (P-006)
After EVERY completed phase/batch, update these files:

1. **ROADMAP.md** → Status, percentage, changelog entry, next steps (MANDATORY)
2. **LESSONS.md** → New patterns or discoveries (if any)
3. **DECISIONS.md** → New architectural decisions (if any)
4. **SOURCES.md** → New sources verified or dates updated (if researching)
5. **CHANGELOG.md** → Milestone entries (for significant completions)
6. Commit with message: `Phase X.Y: [action] [subject]`
7. **README.md** → Check if landing page needs updating:
   - Skill count changed? Update package table
   - Phase milestone reached? Update "Current Progress" section
   - New documentation added? Update docs table

Timing: IMMEDIATE after completion, not deferred.

---

## Session End Protocol (P-007)
Before ending ANY session:

1. **ROADMAP.md** → Update current phase status + "Next Steps" section (CRITICAL - this is how the next session knows where to continue)
2. **LESSONS.md** → Log anything learned during this session
3. **DECISIONS.md** → Record any decisions made
4. **CHANGELOG.md** → Add entry if milestone reached
5. Commit all changes with descriptive message
6. Verify **README.md** reflects current project state

---

## Inter-Agent Protocol (P-008)
Not applicable in the traditional sense — this project uses Claude Code Agent tool, not oa-cli.

Agents are spawned via the Agent tool within Claude Code. Results are collected automatically when the agent completes. No explicit messaging protocol needed.

### How it works:
- Meta-orchestrator composes a prompt with full context
- Agent tool spawns a subagent with that prompt
- Subagent executes and returns results
- Meta-orchestrator validates output against REQUIREMENTS.md
- Accept or respawn with corrections

---

## Error Recovery Protocol (P-009)
### When things go wrong during skill creation or research:

1. **Agent produces incorrect output** → Do NOT accept. Identify the specific error. Respawn agent with correction instructions and the original context.
2. **Source documentation is ambiguous** → Cross-reference with source code on GitHub. Document the ambiguity in LESSONS.md. Make a decision and record in DECISIONS.md.
3. **Conflicting information between sources** → Official docs win. If official docs conflict with source code, source code wins. Document in LESSONS.md.
4. **Session interrupted** → Follow Session Start Protocol (P-001). ROADMAP.md contains recovery state. Git log shows last committed work.
5. **Quality gate fails** → Do NOT proceed to next batch. Fix all issues in current batch first. Document patterns in LESSONS.md to prevent recurrence.
6. **File conflicts** → NEVER have two agents working on the same file. If detected, abort conflicting agent and respawn with correct file scope.
